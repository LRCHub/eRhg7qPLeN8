Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
Traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
Traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

I wanna use you and abuse you
I wanna know what's inside you

Hold your head up
Keep your head up

Hold your head up
Keep your head up

Hold your head up
Keep your head up

Movin' on

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
Traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

I'm gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside
Gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside you

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
Traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something.
